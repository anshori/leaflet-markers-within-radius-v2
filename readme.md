#Leaflet formula: Markers within radius v2
[Live demo](http://csessig86.github.io/leaflet-markers-within-radius/)

This demo shows how to calculate how many points are within a radius using [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/). It's version two of [a project I released a few years ago](https://github.com/csessig86/leaflet-markers-within-radius). The difference is this project does not require you to put in an address. You can just put a marker on the map using [Leaflet.draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw).
